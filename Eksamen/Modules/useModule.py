#A python module is nothing but a package to encapsulate reusable code. ... 
# Classes, in the other hand, can be defined in your main application code or inside modules imported by your application. 
# Classes are the code of Object Oriented Programming and can contain properties and methods


#A module is used to specify the functionality of the logic. 
# For example if you are building a counter you would use a module to define the functionality (up behavior/down behavior/reset behavior) of the counter.
#An interface as the name suggests is used to specify the interface behaviour. 
# If your counter can be configured using an AHB interface, then you would specify the AHB behavior in the interface construct. 
# An interface can be used as I/O for the module.
#An interface is used to model the interactions of the testbench to the module.
